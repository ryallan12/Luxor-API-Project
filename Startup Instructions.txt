This project is broken up into 3 parts.
1. docker-compose.yaml
2. postgress web service - javascript
3. test script - javascript

It's easiest if 3 consoles are used. 

Using VScode open the main "LUXOR - TECHNICAL SALES...." foler, it contains two separate folders. 
Folder 1 "sales-engineer-...." contains the docker-compose file, which brings up the postgress DB
Folder 1 "sales-engineer-...." contains the postgress webservice which acts as the intermediary between the test script and the DP
Folder 2 "Test Project" contains the test script

In Folder 1, in the console type "docker-compose up" to spin up the container containing the postgress database 
In Folder 1, in a second console type "node api.js" to spin up the web service 
In Folder 2, in the console type "node app2.mjs" to start the test script 

Once the test script is running follow the instructions prompted into the console

I used a powershell console 

Optional, I used an app called Postman to view the contents of the database. 
Run a GET command in the app using "http://localhost:3300/sample_table/" to retrieve contents of the database.
